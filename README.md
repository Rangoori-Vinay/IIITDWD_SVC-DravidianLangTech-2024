## Breaking Language Barriers: Hate Speech Detection in Telugu-English Code-Mixed Text

This repository contains the code and resources used in our submission to the **DravidianLangTech@EACL-2024** shared task for **Hate Speech Detection** in Telugu-English code-mixed text. Our team, **IIITDWD_SVC**, participated in the competition, and our BERT-based model achieved the **14th rank** with a macro F1 score of **0.6565**.

## Overview

Social media platforms are commonly used for communication, but they are also exploited to spread hate and offensive content. The **DravidianLangTech@EACL-2024** task was designed to detect hate speech in Telugu-English (Tenglish) code-mixed text, focusing on classifying social media comments into hate or non-hate categories.

Our approach involved transliteration, translation, and tokenization processes, followed by training on three models:
- **BERT**
- **Hate-BERT**
- **XLM-RoBERTa**

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this task was provided by the organizers of the **DravidianLangTech@EACL-2024** shared task. It consists of comments collected from YouTube.

### Data Distribution

| Set    | Hate  | Non-Hate | Total  |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| Train  | 1939  | 2061     | 4000   |
| Test   | 250   | 250      | 500    |

---

## Methodology

We followed a multi-step approach to preprocess the data and build the classification models:

1. **Transliteration**: Converted Telugu content written in English script to the Telugu script using the IndicXlit model.
2. **Translation**: Translated Telugu text to English using the IndicTrans2 model for compatibility with pre-trained models.
3. **Tokenization**: Tokenized the translated text using the Hugging Face library, with specific tokenizers for each model.

---

## Models Used

### 1. **BERT**
- We utilized the pre-trained **BERT-Base Uncased** model for embedding extraction.

### 2. **Hate-BERT**
- **Hate-BERT**, trained on banned Reddit posts, was used for detecting abusive language.

### 3. **XLM-RoBERTa**
- A cross-lingual RoBERTa model trained on 100 different languages, including Telugu and English.

## Results

Our model's performance was evaluated using macro F1 score, and we ranked **14th** in the shared task. Below is a summary of our results compared to other top teams:

| Team       | F1 Score | Rank |
|------------|-----------|------|
| Sandalphon | 0.7711    | 1    |
| IIITDWD_SVC | 0.6565   | 14   |
